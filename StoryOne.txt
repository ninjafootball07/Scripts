One God is good. He created the universe and gave us free will. He sent his Son to die for our sins and gave us the resurrection. The other god also had a son who was born when a woman was raped and impregnated by an angel. She was given knowledge that would have killed her if she had not been protected by the archangel. His blood was spilled on the ground, and from it sprang forth great evil. Adam and Eve became one with the earth and were given dominion over all living things.
Now about me. My lack of faith led me to the path of darkness, and I lost everything I once had. It took me a long time to recover from the damage that this caused. Now it is only through recording my experiences and talking to others that I can truly understand why people are lost. The quest for truth can take us to places many people would rather avoid. My name is Regan and my character's nickname is Little Hood. I am friendly with local wolves and rabbits who find my tasty treats.
"I was recruited to serve as your guide and protector on the journey ahead." Regan paused, staring at him intently. "Do you know what they call us?" she asked. One eye opened a crack. A small smile crossed his lips. He nodded. "The Knights of Lazarus," answered Father Wolf in his deep voice. 
"Father Wolf?" asked Regan. He hadn't heard the giant shuffle in the field. His large frame was encased in black armor, with glowing green eyes piercing through as he walked. The monk was taller than Regan, but otherwise she bore little resemblance to Father Wolf. He was slender, dressed in rough gray clothing, with a hood pulled up over his head and a crudely made spear in hand. A short cape draped around his shoulders. Beneath this came a simple white shirt, worn open at his throat and exposing a small patch of pale skin. With a soldier's steady confidence, he stood straight and tall with arms crossed, head held high. Black leather gloves covered both hands. Only his face was uncovered, revealing pink, swollen skin, smooth cheeks, and deep greenish brown eyes. They burned with pure rage and hatred. These eyes were human, but they did not belong to a man. 
Regan watched while Shamus took several steps closer to them, turning toward them from time to time. Even though he didn't speak, Regan heard every word he said. In the back of his mind, he could sense their connection as well, but he decided against speaking for now. Her tall figure continued to walk toward them, her long blonde hair flowing around her like waves. She wasn't the most beautiful woman in the world, but that didn't stop people from falling in love with her. 
"We appreciate your help." Father Wolf replied casually. Regan's heart sank when she saw the look of contempt and hatred in those dark eyes. Then her fear turned to confusion as she realized something else was wrong.

"What are we doing here?" she demanded. As if her question was meant to be insulting. This reaction was more than enough to confirm what Father Wolf already knew, or thought he did. He strode forward quickly, a smile on his lips, showing his fangs. The tips of his razor-sharp teeth glistened as he prepared to begin feeding. He would answer her question with his teeth. All thought left Regan's mind as the sight of his blood filled it. It didn't take him long to feed. His face twisted into an evil grin and he began gobbling down. Slurping down. Drooling as he chomped into the ghastly dead mother before him. Forcing his way into her flesh, tearing away at her as blood seeped into his veins. Blood dripped down, down into the earth beneath and sprayed into the air above. Something dark flooded inside of his belly, flooding away all human emotion. Dark emotions filled his brain until they bubbled out in gurgles, sputtering forth from within his throat. There was no longer a person within his body. A new being formed a place there, one who had once been called Adam which means man. Slowly he began sucking in breaths again. Soon his chest would be full. For now, the creature was satisfied with feeding on an innocent human. As if that were acceptable.
Regan wanted to stop them but knew it could only make things worse. She could sense how furious Shamus was becoming. This was something she knew from childhood, something her mother warned them about. Men like Father Wolf, or those who thought so little of humans, could cause immense damage if given enough time to think things over. Suddenly there were shouts coming from the crowd. Reflections of bright light surrounded Regan and the wolves.
Even more people were beginning to form a line along the path, waiting to speak. They came from everywhere; some walking out into the open field, while others were hiding behind bushes. Many of them wore robes made of the same material as Father Wolf's armor and carried swords they had drawn from their scabbards. These men and women would have looked like any other group of travelers, except their faces were twisted and ugly. Each held a spear in hand. Their eyes burned with hatred for everyone around them.
It wasn't long before others arrived. Father Wolf led Regan to a camp filled with discarded weapons. The weapons had been taken from fallen bodies over the years. Some were collected from houses abandoned and left to rot. Others were gathered during battles between soldiers or villagers. A few were brought here by creatures known as ghouls who loved blood, and others just happened upon this place. Each one bearing the name 'Marley' etched in its center.
"Objective confirmed," commanded Father Wolf. His eyes scanned the landscape and then moved back to Regan. "The enemy is with us." He looked to Shamus and ordered, "Begin our attacks." For a moment all was silent. Then out of the dark Shamus began clawing littering the field with bones. Turning toward those gathered around, he screamed at them. Running toward Father Wolf at full speed with spear in paw, this massive creature leaped many times his height. Long strands of hair dangled from his head like a lion's mane. As he drew closer, all the hatred in him was unleashed. He lunged forward, striking with his spear at four more figures who had rushed forth and joined their leader. Their faces were nothing more than skulls atop long necks, this was the first glimpse Regan even had of the enemy. Each wore itchy grey fur. "Come on!" shouted Echo to the other two wolves surrounding Shamus. Shamus let loose a loud roar, spurring several others forward. They all charged his attacker, ready to defend. Echo quickly made a dash for the monster. She wrapped her hand around a thick piece of metal protruding from the beast's spine. Gently, with slow movements, she pulled the weapon away. A shriek came from inside. Sound filled the air, almost like music, but deadly.
Shamus immediately reached out and grasped the ankle of the monster. "You're mine." The words rallied throughout the forest, reaching the mountainside and returning again. Wiping some of the ghoul blood from his claws, Father Wolf leaned down and unleashed his cubs upon everything in sight. From that moment on, attacks against them would have no effect. No matter how many times they tried, no amount of force or magic could defeat him. The last thing anyone heard was an ear splitting roar as two more wolves leapt forward, ripping away pieces of arms and heads.
"Enough," called Father Wolf from behind them. He stood up on his hind legs, towering above them. They turned around to see him standing there with his paws crossed. "We've done what we set out to do. We've stopped the attack. Now we must destroy these ones. Do you understand?"
"Yes," answered Regan.
Father Wolf nodded, satisfied. "Good. Let's go."
They walked together through the woods until they came to a large clearing. In the middle was a large log cabin. It stood tall, yet thin, with only one window facing outward. Atop the roof sat a cross. The body of the cross was carved into the shape of a wolf. Inside the cabin was a fire burning and a table covered with food. On the table was a plate with meat, bread, and pickles. Next to the plate was a bottle of wine.
Regan stared in amazement. She couldn't imagine where they got all this food and wine. This didn't look like a place for people. It looked more like a hunting lodge for bears.
Father Wolf stepped inside the door. Regan followed him. The room was small and sparsely furnished. There was a bed, a chair, a table, and a fireplace. The floor was stone, and the walls were bare. It was cold inside.
Father Wolf pawed at the wood paneled wall next to the fireplace. He pulled off a panel revealing a safe. Inside was a gold bar. He took it out and placed it on the table. "This is yours now."
Regan looked at him. "I don't know what to say. I'm so grateful."
He smiled at her. "It wasn't easy for me either. But I did it because you asked me to. You are my family, and I love you very much."
She hugged him tightly. "I love you too. Thank you for everything you've done for me."
"Anytime, anytime," he said. "Now come and eat while the meat is still warm."
Regan followed him to the table. She put the gold bar on the table and grabbed a knife. After a few bites, she realized that her mouth was dry. She went to the kitchen and poured herself a glass of water. Standing at the stove, she watched Father Wolf grab another plate of food and sit down across from her. He pointed to the empty plates. "Eat."
She picked up her fork and took a bite. The meat was tender. It was the best she'd ever tasted. She had never seen anything like it. She finished the whole plate, and then sat back and looked at the others. They all had a big smile on their faces.
"What's so funny?" asked Echo to Giselle.
"It's just... well, it's kind of funny."
"What's funny?" asked Regan.
"She is the first human to ever eat here," said Giselle.
Regan turned to look at Shamus. "Did you do that?" Regan point to some art in the corner.
"Yes," he answered. "It's not often someone comes through our gate, so I thought I would surprise you."
"I have never been in a battle like that before, I feel like I could eat a horse." said Regan.
Shamus chuckled. "That's because your mother told us stories about humans eating horses when they fight. That's why everyone always says 'horseshoes' instead of shoes. Well if you want something else, maybe..."
"No, thank you. I think I'll pass."
"Oh alright. Just be careful though; sometimes those can be hard to chew."
Regan laughed. "Well thanks again. I hope you're feeling better after getting sick."
"Much better. Thanks for asking."
A knock sounded on the front door. "Who could that be?" wondered Echo.
Giselle went to answer it. A man dressed as a soldier entered carrying bags of supplies. He wore a helmet with horns coming out the top, a black coat, pants, boots, gloves, and a sword strapped to his side.
"Hello sir," greeted Giselle. "How may I help you today?"
The man bowed slightly. "We received word that there has been a breach in security along the border between Saint Oresia and North Silesia. We need assistance patrolling the area. Are any of your pack rested enough to join?"
"Of course!" exclaimed Echo.
The man nodded. "Excellent! Let them gather their belongings, we leave soon." Turning around he left, closing the door behind himself.
Echo ran upstairs to get ready. All three women gathered their weapons and armor.
