      "\nNow about me. My lack of faith led me to the path of darkness, and I lost everything I once had. It took me a long time to recover from the damage that this caused. Now it is only through recording my experiences and talking to others that I can truly understand why people are lost. The quest for truth can take us to places many people would rather avoid.",
      " My name is Regan and my character's nickname is Little Hood. I am friendly with local wolves and rabbits who find my tasty treats.",
      "\n\"I was recruited to serve as your guide and protector on the journey ahead.\" Regan paused, staring at him intently. \"Do you know what they call us?\" she asked. One eye opened a crack. A small smile crossed his lips. He nodded. \"The Knights of Lazarus,\" answered Father Wolf in his deep voice.",
      " \n\"Father Wolf?\" asked Regan. He hadn't heard the giant shuffle in the field. His large frame was encased in black armor, with glowing green eyes piercing through as he walked. The monk was taller than Regan, but otherwise she bore little resemblance to Father Wolf. He was slender, dressed in rough gray clothing, with a hood pulled up over his head and a crudely made spear in hand. A short cape draped around his shoulders. Beneath this came a simple white shirt, worn open at his throat and exposing a small patch of pale skin. With a soldier's steady confidence, he stood straight and tall with arms crossed, head held high. Black leather gloves covered both hands. Only his face was uncovered, revealing pink, swollen skin, smooth cheeks, and deep greenish brown eyes. They burned with pure rage and hatred. These eyes were human, but they did not belong to a man. \nRegan watched while Shamus took several steps closer to them, turning toward them from time to time. Even though he didn't speak, Regan heard every word he said. In the back of his mind, he could sense their connection as well, but he decided against speaking for now.",
      " Her tall figure continued to walk toward them, her long blonde hair flowing around her like waves. She wasn't the most beautiful woman in the world, but that didn't stop people from falling in love with her. \n\"We appreciate your help.\" Father Wolf replied casually. Regan's heart sank when she saw the look of contempt and hatred in those dark eyes. Then her fear turned to confusion as she realized something else was wrong.",
      "\n\n\"What are we doing here?\" she demanded. As if her question was meant to be insulting. This reaction was more than enough to confirm what Father Wolf already knew, or thought he did. He strode forward quickly, a smile on his lips, showing his fangs. The tips of his razor-sharp teeth glistened as he prepared to begin feeding. He would answer her question with his teeth. All thought left Regan's mind as the sight of his blood filled it. It didn't take him long to feed. His face twisted into an evil grin and he began gobbling down. Slurping down. Drooling as he chomped into the ghastly dead mother before him. Forcing his way into her flesh, tearing away at her as blood seeped into his veins. Blood dripped down, down into the earth beneath and sprayed into the air above. Something dark flooded inside of his belly, flooding away all human emotion. Dark emotions filled his brain until they bubbled out in gurgles, sputtering forth from within his throat. There was no longer a person within his body. A new being formed a place there, one who had once been called Adam which means man. Slowly he began sucking in breaths again. Soon his chest would be full. For now, the creature was satisfied with feeding on an innocent human. As if that were acceptable.\nRegan wanted to stop them but knew it could only make things worse. She could sense how furious Shamus was becoming. This was something she knew from childhood, something her mother warned them about. Men like Father Wolf, or those who thought so little of humans, could cause immense damage if given enough time to think things over. Suddenly there were shouts coming from the crowd. Reflections of bright light surrounded Regan and the wolves.\nEven more people were beginning to form a line along the path, waiting to speak. They came from everywhere; some walking out into the open field, while others were hiding behind bushes. Many of them wore robes made of the same material as Father Wolf's armor and carried swords they had drawn from their scabbards. These men and women would have looked like any other group of travelers, except their faces were twisted and ugly. Each held a spear in hand. Their eyes burned with hatred for everyone around them.\nIt wasn't long before others arrived.",
      " Father Wolf led Regan to a camp filled with discarded weapons. The weapons had been taken from fallen bodies over the years. Some were collected from houses abandoned and left to rot. Others were gathered during battles between soldiers or villagers. A few were brought here by creatures known as ghouls who loved blood, and others just happened upon this place. Each one bearing the name 'Marley' etched in its center.\n\"Objective confirmed,\" commanded Father Wolf. His eyes scanned the landscape and then moved back to Regan. \"The enemy is with us.\" He looked to Shamus and ordered, \"Begin our attacks.\" For a moment all was silent. Then out of the dark Shamus began clawing littering the field with bones. Turning toward those gathered around, he screamed at them. Running toward Father Wolf at full speed with spear in paw, this massive creature leaped many times his height. Long strands of hair dangled from his head like a lion's mane. As he drew closer, all the hatred in him was unleashed. He lunged forward, striking with his spear at four more figures who had rushed forth and joined their leader. Their faces were nothing more than skulls atop long necks, this was the first glimpse Regan even had of the enemy. Each wore itchy grey fur.",
      " \"Come on!\" shouted Echo to the other two wolves surrounding Shamus. Shamus let loose a loud roar, spurring several others forward. They all charged his attacker, ready to defend. Echo quickly made a dash for the monster. She wrapped her hand around a thick piece of metal protruding from the beast's spine. Gently, with slow movements, she pulled the weapon away. A shriek came from inside. Sound filled the air, almost like music, but deadly.\nShamus immediately reached out and grasped the ankle of the monster.",
      " \"You're mine.\" The words rallied throughout the forest, reaching the mountainside and returning again. Wiping some of the ghoul blood from his claws, Father Wolf leaned down and unleashed his cubs upon everything in sight. From that moment on, attacks against them would have no effect. No matter how many times they tried, no amount of force or magic could defeat him. The last thing anyone heard was an ear splitting roar as two more wolves leapt forward, ripping away pieces of arms and heads.\n\"Enough,\" called Father Wolf from behind them.",
      " He stood up on his hind legs, towering above them. They turned around to see him standing there with his paws crossed. \"We've done what we set out to do. We've stopped the attack. Now we must destroy these ones. Do you understand?\"\n\"Yes,\" answered Regan.\nFather Wolf nodded, satisfied. \"Good. Let's go.\"\nThey walked together through the woods until they came to a large clearing. In the middle was a large log cabin. It stood tall, yet thin, with only one window facing outward. Atop the roof sat a cross. The body of the cross was carved into the shape of a wolf. Inside the cabin was a fire burning and a table covered with food. On the table was a plate with meat, bread, and pickles. Next to the plate was a bottle of wine.\nRegan stared in amazement. She couldn't imagine where they got all this food and wine. This didn't look like a place for people. It looked more like a hunting lodge for bears.\nFather Wolf stepped inside the door. Regan followed him. The room was small and sparsely furnished. There was a bed, a chair, a table, and a fireplace.",
      " The floor was stone, and the walls were bare. It was cold inside.\nFather Wolf pawed at the wood paneled wall next to the fireplace. He pulled off a panel revealing a safe. Inside was a gold bar. He took it out and placed it on the table. \"This is yours now.\"\nRegan looked at him. \"I don't know what to say. I'm so grateful.\"\nHe smiled at her. \"It wasn't easy for me either. But I did it because you asked me to. You are my family, and I love you very much.\"\nShe hugged him tightly. \"I love you too. Thank you for everything you've done for me.\"\n\"Anytime, anytime,\" he said. \"Now come and eat while the meat is still warm.\"\nRegan followed him to the table. She put the gold bar on the table and grabbed a knife. After a few bites, she realized that her mouth was dry. She went to the kitchen and poured herself a glass of water. Standing at the stove, she watched Father Wolf grab another plate of food and sit down across from her. He pointed to the empty plates. \"Eat.\"\nShe picked up her fork and took a bite.",
      " The meat was tender. It was the best she'd ever tasted. She had never seen anything like it. She finished the whole plate, and then sat back and looked at the others. They all had a big smile on their faces.\n\"What's so funny?\" asked Echo to Giselle.",
      "\n\"It's just... well, it's kind of funny.\"\n\"What's funny?\" asked Regan.\n\"She is the first human to ever eat here,\" said Giselle.",
      "\nRegan turned to look at Shamus. \"Did you do that?\" Regan point to some art in the corner.\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"It's not often someone comes through our gate",
      ", so I thought I would surprise you.\"\n\"I have never been in a battle like that before, I feel like I could eat a horse.\" said Regan.\nShamus chuckled. \"That's because",
      " your mother told us stories about humans eating horses when they fight. That's why everyone always says 'horseshoes' instead of shoes. Well if you want something else, maybe...\"",
      "\n\"No, thank you. I think I'll pass.\"\n\"Oh alright. Just be careful though; sometimes those can be hard to chew.\"\nRegan laughed. \"Well thanks again. I hope you're feeling better after getting sick.\"\n\"Much better. Thanks for asking.\"\nA knock sounded on the front door. \"Who could that be?\" wondered Echo.",
      "\nGiselle went to answer it. A man dressed as a soldier entered carrying bags of supplies. He wore a helmet with horns coming out the top, a black coat, pants, boots, gloves, and a sword strapped to his side.\n\"Hello sir,\" greeted Giselle. \"How may I help you today?\"\nThe man bowed slightly.",
      " \"We received word that there has been a breach in security along the border between Saint Oresia and North Silesia. We need assistance patrolling the area. Are any of your pack rested enough to join?\"",
      "\n\"Of course!\" exclaimed Echo.\nThe man nodded. \"Excellent! Let them gather their belongings, we leave soon.\" Turning around he left, closing the door behind himself.\nEcho ran upstairs to get ready. All three women gathered their weapons and armor.",
      " When they came downstairs they saw that most of the men were gone already. Only four remained standing outside. One of these belonged to Josephine, who stood talking to two soldiers near the stable. Her husband James was walking towards the house. As he approached, Echo waved to him. She walked to meet him halfway.\nJosephine noticed them approaching together. Looking away from her conversation, she spoke quickly.",
      " \"James, this is Echo. She's going with you guys tonight.\"\n\"Nice to meet you Echo,\" he said extending his hand.\nShe shook it. \"You too.\"\nThen turning to Josephine, \"Why am I tagging along? This doesn't make sense.\"\n\"I didn't tell you yet? There isn't time right now, but later I promise you can ask questions. Now let's go. Chop chop.\"",
      " With that, she turned and headed toward the stables. Echo sighed and followed her.\nAs they passed through the gates, Echo couldn't believe how many people lived inside. Somewhere deep within the forest, she heard wolves singing. They surrounded the entire property, surrounding both houses. Their voices rose higher. It was a song of protection. A song of warning.",
      " \nThe voices were meant to calm the humans in the territory. Regan stopped to listen. The wolves near her froze where they stood and joined in. Even the breeze seemed to join with her voice. A spiritual presence filled the air",
      ". It felt familiar.\nRegan closed her eyes and listened closely. Something stirred inside her. It whispered to her mind. She opened her mouth and began to sing softly. The sound echoed off the trees and traveled far into the night sky. Until finally, faintly, she heard a chorus answering her.",
      " Another wolf sang beside her. Soon more joined until hundreds poured forth from every direction. In unison, each voice united under the moonlit sky creating harmony beyond compare. Each note carried power and authority. And when each song ended, another started up somewhere. Each new melody blended perfectly with the voices. So much so that no single listener knew which notes belonged only to themselves.",
      " Together, they formed a symphony unlike anything she had experienced before. It was the perfect expression of the pack. A single wolf may have difficulty understanding his or her own significance. But the pack - human words cannot describe such beauty. Its purpose was clear:",
      " To protect its home. To warn intruders, and to celebrate life itself. The voice of the wolf would keep watch while they slept. Able to warn against danger. Most importantly this anthem united them despite differences. For without unity, none are truly safe. Without community, life becomes meaningless. Regan continued listening intently. It wasn't just some old song. These weren't random noises. These sounds flowed through her veins.\nWhen the last chord died down, the sun began to rise. Everything quieted except for the sounds made by nature herself. Birds chirped while crickets buzzed. An owl hooted mournfully one last time. Bugs hummed and crackled beneath the leaves. The patrol had ended.",
      "\nThe next day they rode all day long through what used to be called East Prussia. Fierce winds whipped across the open plains, driving wild clouds above their heads. Lightning flashed erratically among dark gray skies. Thunder rumbled ominously throughout the land like rolling thunderclaps. Occasionally rain pelted them from above and soaked everyone to the bone.",
      " By sunset though, the storm abated as suddenly as it appeared. Daylight faded slowly out of sight.\nIn the distance ahead, silhouetted figures could see tall buildings rising high above the horizon. Flashes lit up the nighttime skyline. Smoke billowed upward from countless chimneys. People moved about below, illuminated by gas lamps. More lights twinkled here than anywhere else on",
      " this planet. If there ever was any doubt whether they'd arrived at their destination, those doubts disappeared instantly upon seeing the city. Everyone looked back at the others changing their gaits as if they were horses. No one needed to say anything. They understood.\nThey reached the outskirts first. Once past the outer ring of defenses, guards saluted them as they entered the inner fortifications. At least thirty heavily armed troops lined either side of the road.",
      " The largest man stepped forward and bowed respectfully to James. After exchanging pleasantries, he directed him to follow the main street straight to the fortress. While passing between two stone columns, Echo spotted something strange. Coins lay scattered around the base. The thirty wore steel armor plates encasing broad shoulders and thick arms. Every soldier held a sword and shield ready for battle. These men were alert and attentive.\nAfter passing between two rows of soldiers, they came face-to-face with four massive iron doors standing wide open.",
      " Two large pillars flanked these doors; flags hung limply along their lengths. Upon closer inspection, Echo noticed someone watching them right outside the gate. As soon as they saw him, the stranger quickly vanished behind the building. Trembling, Echo remembered being watched once before. This feeling didn't go away easily. He wanted to growl at the intruder. Before heading further, Echo glanced again at the coins lying on the floor. There must've been thousands since nothing had disturbed them yet.",
      "\nThe guard guarding the gates led them through the courtyard and into a grand hallway. They walked down a long corridor. The guards stayed close to them, but they didn't seem to care anymore. Echo wondered how many people they'd already killed.",
      " The halls echoed with the clank of swords and shields. Echoes of footsteps filled the air. Doors opened and closed. Soldiers rushed by, shouting orders. Echo tried to count the number of times she heard the word 'attack' repeated. There seemed to be no end to the training within these walls.",
      "\nFinally, they stopped in front of a door. The guard knocked twice then opened it. \"Please, come in,\" said a voice.\nThe room was small, but much more comfortable than anything they'd seen so far. A soft carpet covered the floor, and a large bed sat against one wall. A fireplace took up another. A few chairs and tables completed the room.",
      " The man who spoke stood near the doorway.\n\"I'm afraid you won't find much here. I don't have much to offer.\"\n\"We're not looking for food or drink. We're looking for knowledge,\" replied James.\n\"Ah, well then, you've come to the right place. Please, take a seat. And remember, this is information is only shared with friends of the planet.",
      " Now, where shall I begin?\"\nJames and the rest settled down on the chairs. The man began his tale. \"My name is John. John the Seer. I'm not sure what you heard about me, but that isn't important now. What matters is, I can see things that others cannot.",
      " My gift has brought me great fortune. For instance, when the humans first came to my home, I knew they would attack. I even knew which army would win. It wasn't long before the humans came for us."
