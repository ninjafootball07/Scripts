      " It was nightfall when we finally reached the outskirts of the city. We had decided to camp out in the woods nearby rather than go back into town. I thought about going to sleep right away but then realized we would be leaving our things unattended if we did. So instead, I sat down near the fire and began reading my book. I looked up at the sky just as there was a flash of red light. At first I thought it was just the setting sun reflecting off of the trees, but then I saw something else. A small dot of light appeared in the sky. It grew bigger and brighter until it became a large sphere.",
      " It was so beautiful that I forgot all about my worries for a moment. The sphere hovered above us, then slowly descended towards the forest. Suddenly, a loud noise erupted from the sphere. It made me jump, and I looked around to see everyone else doing the same. The sphere stopped its descent and flew over our heads. Then it turned around and flew back in the direction it came from. Everyone watched silently as it disappeared into the distance, not knowing what to make of this. After a few minutes, I heard someone whisper something in a language I didn't understand. I looked around and saw everyone nodding. \"Gods,\" I whispered, and everyone nodded.",

Eventually, the others left to go to bed while I stayed up to read some more. I fell asleep sometime after midnight. When I woke up, the others were gone and it was pitch black outside.",
      " I got up, grabbed a blanket, and headed out into the woods. I walked for hours, trying to find a place to stay the night. Eventually, I found a small cave, which had a nice stream running through it. I took a quick dip in the cool water. I lay back down on the soft mossy ground, and soon fell asleep.\nWhen I awoke, the sun was shining brightly. My body ached, and I felt terrible. I checked myself over and saw that I was covered in scratches. I looked around and noticed that I was alone. I stood up and walked to the edge of the cave."

I really wished I had brought a stove or something. The next day, we continued to walk through the forest. We had walked for about three days before we started to notice signs of civilization.
