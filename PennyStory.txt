The land is split by a river, and the people are divided into two camps: those who live on the east bank and those who live on the west. The east-west river divides the already diverse population into an ever-smaller number of tribes and villages. There were more towns along one side because it's where trade routes went through to get from one country to another. The lava put a halt to that, the river has been filled partially with lava, and the only way to cross the boiling water is by bridge. That bridge has been destroyed. Upon close inspection of the rubble around the city, it is discovered that the old stone foundations for the extremely ancient bridge still remain. It's said that the people living on the other side of the river have built a huge wall around their entire village, so no one could come across the river.  It was nightfall when we finally reached the outskirts of the city. We had decided to camp out in the woods nearby rather than go back into town. I thought about going to sleep right away but then realized we would be leaving our things unattended if we did. So instead, I sat down near the fire and began reading my book. I looked up at the sky just as there was a flash of red light. At first I thought it was just the setting sun reflecting off of the trees, but then I saw something else. A small dot of light appeared in the sky. It grew bigger and brighter until it became a large sphere. It was so beautiful that I forgot all about my worries for a moment. The sphere hovered above us, then slowly descended towards the forest. Suddenly, a loud noise erupted from the sphere. It made me jump, and I looked around to see everyone else doing the same. The sphere stopped its descent and flew over our heads. Then it turned around and flew back in the direction it came from. Everyone watched silently as it disappeared into the distance, not knowing what to make of this. After a few minutes, I heard someone whisper something in a language I didn't understand. I looked around and saw everyone nodding. "Gods," I whispered, and everyone nodded. We all stared at each other for a long time before turning back to watch the forest. "Wow," I said, "I've never seen anything like that."
"It's a god," someone answered.
"No, it can't be," someone else argued.
"You don't know what you're talking about," someone shouted.
"Yes, I do," I shouted back.
We continued arguing for hours. Eventually, the others left to go to bed while I stayed up to read some more. I fell asleep sometime after midnight. When I woke up, the others were gone and it was pitch black outside. I got up, grabbed a blanket, and headed out into the woods. I walked for hours, trying to find a place to stay the night. Eventually, I found a small cave, which had a nice stream running through it. I took a quick dip in the cool water. I lay back down on the soft mossy ground, and soon fell asleep.
When I awoke, the sun was shining brightly. My body ached, and I felt terrible. I checked myself over and saw that I was covered in scratches. I looked around and noticed that I was alone. I stood up and walked to the edge of the cave. I looked down and saw that my clothes were torn and dirty. They must have been roughed up by the river. I looked down and saw that I was still wearing my leather sandals. I sighed and began walking.
As I walked, I tried to remember what happened yesterday. I remembered seeing the strange sphere and the rest of the people staring at it. I also remembered them arguing among themselves. I don't remember anything else. I stretched my arms and legs, then walked back towards a traveling merchant I knew frequented this area. When I spotted them, I walked over and bought a bag of apples and some fresh clothes. I could see a tiny village about a mile away. The smoke from the chimneys swirled in the air as if beckoning me to come. I got dressed and started walking. I headed straight for the nearest house. I knocked on the door, but no one answered. I knocked again, and then I heard someone inside call out. I opened the door and stepped inside. I was looking at a man that I recognized. He was the banker of the village. His name was Jadus. He was very short, but he was strong. He was balding, and his face was wrinkled. He smiled at me. "Welcome," he said, "come sit down and tell me all about your journey." I sat down. "Where did you get these clothes?"
"I bought them from a merchant."
"He must be a lucky man to have such pretty things," he said with a wink.
"I guess so," I said. I told him everything that happened yesterday. He laughed and slapped me on the back. "That's amazing!" he exclaimed. "You should write a story! You know what? I'll give you some money."
